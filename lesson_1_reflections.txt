How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The diff is where the problem lies.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Test different specifications.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: easier to understand changes made and compare different versions.
    Con: prone to user error and poor habits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is designed for version control, and saving multiple files in one commit
    is a useful feature to have.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows the history of commits, and git diff gives differences between
    two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Much more confident, since I have back ups.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Data science projects.
