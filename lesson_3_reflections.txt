When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    Collaborate with others. Publish code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Others might make changes to the remote repository that I don't want to pull yet.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
    Branches are different versions of code within one single repository.
    Clones are copies of other repositories, either remote ones or local ones.
    Forks are copies of other Github repositories, stored on Github.
    
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    So that Git Status can tell me the progress made on a local computer relative to the 
    last known state of the remote. Also, when fetching data from remote, only new changes
    in the remote need to be fetched.
    
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would 
be harder?
    I would share a common dropbox folder with collaborators and store code there.
    Easier: don't have to make sure that everyone knows how to use Git and GitHub.
    Harder: version control, workflow.
    
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
    When colaborating with others or trying out new features.
